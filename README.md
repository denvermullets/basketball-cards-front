### Basket-ball.cards

Just a simple basketball card game. This is the Reactjs frontend for the game. Pretty standard React project, I used styled components and basic CSS. Nothing crazy.

[NodeJs api available here](https://github.com/denvermullets/basketball-cards-api)

Eventually we'll keep a scoreboard of all the teams played so we can laugh at some of the random makeup of teams.
